# WeatherApp
This is my first small JAVA Application/Project. 
This Project consists of 3 classes:
1- WeatherApp: The class containing the main method.
2- WeatherAppFunctionality: This is the class consisting of all the backend logic used to get data using free APIs(One for the weather data, and the other for the timezones data).
3- WeatherAppGui: This class consists of all the icons, buttons, text fields etc.
